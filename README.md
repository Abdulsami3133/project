# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project demonstrates a simple **Machine Learning classification** task using the **Iris dataset** from `scikit-learn`.  
It uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species based on four input features.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Iris Flower Dataset**, one of the most famous datasets in machine learning.  
It contains **150 samples** from **three species** of iris flowers:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

Each sample has **four features**:
1. Sepal length (cm)  
2. Sepal width (cm)  
3. Petal length (cm)  
4. Petal width (cm)
